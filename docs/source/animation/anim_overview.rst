Animation Overview
======================================

The way we make animation is to utilize the ``OmniGraph``, ``Action Graph``, and ``Animation Graph`` in Omniverse. Along with the graphic expression, we try to manage the animation building by transferring it to coding-based method. Those documentations are really helpful for our work:

* `OmniGraph <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_extensions/prod_extensions/ext_omnigraph.html>`_
* `Action Graph <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_create/prod_extensions/ext_omnigraph/quickstart.html>`_
* `Animation Graph <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_extensions/prod_extensions/ext_animation-graph.html>`_
