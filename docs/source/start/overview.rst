Toolkit overview
===============================================================

To facilitate the study of **indoor scene building** methods and their potential
applications for `robotics`, `animation`, and `Embodied AI`, we introduce VRKITCHEN2.0: a toolkit built by NVIDIA OMNIVERSE that provides flexible pipelines for indoor scene building, scene randomizing, and robotic controls. 

Besides, by combining Python coding in the animation software VRKITCHEN2.0 can assist researches in
creating real-time training and control for robotics in the future.

Demo 1: Build customized high-quality indoor scenes

Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) has attracted significant attention, both in advanced deep
learning models and algorithms and the rapid development of simulated platforms. Many open challenges have been proposed to facilitate EAI research. A critical bottleneck in existing simulated platforms is the **limited number of indoor scenes** that support vision-and-language navigation, object interaction, and complex household tasks.

In this tutiral :ref:`Tutorial Indoor`, we shall present how to import thousands of room layouts from the original `3D-Front dataset` into `Omniverse` to give a photo-realistic effect for EAI tasks.
