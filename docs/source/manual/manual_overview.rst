Extented Omniverse Kit User Manual
============================================

We strongly recommend users to take a look at the official API documentation for 

* `Omniverse Kit API <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_kit/prod_kit/overview.html>`_
* `Pixar USD Documentation <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/api/>`_
* `Omniverse Isaac-Sim Documentation <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/py/isaacsim/source/extensions/omni.isaac.core/docs/index.html>`_

as we ourselves have learned all the coding lessons from those three documentations.
