Extented Omniverse Kit User Manual
============================================

We strongly recommend users to take a look at the official API documentation for 

* ``Omniverse Kit``(`API link <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_kit/prod_kit/overview.html>`_)
* ``Pixar USD``(`API link <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/api/>`_)
* ``Omniverse Isaac-Sim``(`API link <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/py/isaacsim/source/extensions/omni.isaac.core/docs/index.html>`_)

as we ourselves have learned all the coding lessons from those three documentations.
